Dhall is a programmable configuration language optimized for
maintainability.

You can think of Dhall as: JSON + functions + types + imports

Note that while Dhall is programmable, Dhall is not Turing-complete.  Many
of Dhall's features take advantage of this restriction to provide stronger
safety guarantees and more powerful tooling.

You can find more details about the language by visiting the official website:
